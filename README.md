This project is a Python-based application that provides a user-friendly interface to interact with a music library database. The application utilizes the sqlite3 module to connect to an SQLite database containing three tables: artists, albums, and songs. The Tkinter library is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).

The main functionality of the application is to display a list of artists, and when an artist is selected, it dynamically updates the album list to show only the albums by that artist. Similarly, when an album is selected, the song list is updated to display the songs associated with that album.
